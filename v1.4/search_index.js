To study the interaction between an ultrafast and intense laser pulse and atoms/molecules, where the electrons are ionized from the targets through multi-photon or tunneling/over-barrier processes, a time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) simulation is usually required to be carried out.

This scheme is named after the Classical Trajectory Monte-Carlo (CTMC) method, which has been widely adopted for research in interaction between high-intensity ultra-fast laser pulses and atoms/molecules.
