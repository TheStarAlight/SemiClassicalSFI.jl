To study the interaction between an ultrafast and intense laser pulse and atoms/molecules, where the electrons are ionized from the targets through multi-photon or tunneling/over-barrier processes, a time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) simulation is usually required to be carried out. However, its high demand in computational resources and limited application scope (atoms and simple molecules) prevents it from its extensive application.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"To overcome the shortcomings of TDSE, Corkum et al. [Corkum_1989] proposed a scheme, where the electron is first ionized from the target through the tunneling mechanism, and then acts as a classical electron in the laser field. This scheme was further developed by Hu et al. [Hu_1997], in which the initial conditions of the classical electrons and the Coulomb potential of the parent ion are more appropriatedly taken account. This scheme is named after the Classical Trajectory Monte-Carlo (CTMC) method, which has been widely adopted for research in interaction between high-intensity ultra-fast laser pulses and atoms/molecules. Compared with TDSE, trajectory simulation schemes including CTMC and its variants, are less demanding in computational resources, which, in addition, provides a clear physical picture of strong-field ionization.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The essence of the trajectory simulation scheme lies in two aspects: (1) The initial conditions of the classical electron samples at the beginning of the classical trajectories, which consists of initial position bmr_0 (i.e., the tunneling exit position), initial momenta bmp_0, and the corresponding ionization probability W carried by the electron sample. (2) The quantum phase property of classical trajectories, while the full classical trajectory (i.e., the CTMC) is widely adopted, there are schemes (e.g., QTMC and SCTS, which would be discussed further in the documentation) which introduce quantum phases in the electron trajectories and develop a semiclassical method for trajectory simulations.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"After decades of accumulation of research and development, the trajectory simulation has grown to a complete solution of research on strong-field ionization of atoms and molecules.
