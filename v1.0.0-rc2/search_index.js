In our theoretical framework, the simulation schemes are named after \"ADK-CTMC\", \"SFA-SPANE-CTMC\" and \"SFA-SPA-CTMC\", respectively.","category":"page"},{"location":"example1_attoclock/","page":"Attoclock & Initial Condition Methods","title":"Attoclock & Initial Condition Methods","text":"# examples/test_2cycs_CP.jl\n\nusing eTraj\nusing eTraj.Targets, eTraj.Lasers, eTraj.Units\n\nl = Cos4Laser(peak_int=0.4PW/cm^2, wave_len=800.0nm, cyc_num=2, ellip=1.0)\nt = get_atom(\"H\")\n\nfor init_cond in [:ADK, :SPANE, :SPA]\n    perform_traj_simulation(\n        init_cond_method    = init_cond,\n        laser               = l,\n        target              = t,\n        dimension           = 2,            # 2D simulation, x-y plane only\n        sample_t_intv       = (-100,100),   # equivalent to `(-2.42fs, 2.42fs)`\n        sample_t_num        = 20000,        # will sample 20000 equidistant time points between -100 and 100 a.u.\n        traj_t_final        = 120,          # the traj end at 120 a.u., equivalent to `2.90fs`\n        final_p_max         = (2.5,2.5),    # the momentum spec collection grid's border (-2.5 to +2.5 a.u.)\n        final_p_num         = (500,500),    # the momentum spec collection grid's size (500x500)\n        ss_kd_max           = 2.0,\n        ss_kd_num           = 10000,        # will sample 10000 equidistant k⟂ points between -2 to +2 a.u.\n        output_path         = \"$(init_cond)-CTMC_4e14_800nm_cos4_2cyc_CP.jld2\",\n        traj_phase_method   = :CTMC\n    )\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"example1_attoclock/","page":"Attoclock & Initial Condition Methods","title":"Attoclock & Initial Condition Methods","text":"The momentum spectra are shown in the figure below. Due to the exponential dependence of ionization rate on the field strength, the PMD exhibits a crescent shape near the peak of the negative vector potential -AA(t). In an adiabatic tunneling scenario, which corresponds to the ADK initial condition, the trace of -AA(t) is expected to match the median of the crescent shape. While for non-adiabatic tunneling, the kkt-dependent probability distribution at the tunneling exit becomes skewed, which results in expansion of the crescent shape and the enhancement of overall ionization probability, as can be seen in the figure. Moreover, the PMD obtained with the SFA-SPANE and SFA-SPA initial conditions shows similar shape and total ionization probability, which demonstrate the SFA-SPANE's advantage of preserving the non-adiabatic effects with much less computational cost than the SFA-SPA.","category":"page"},{"location":"example1_attoclock/","page":"Attoclock & Initial Condition Methods","title":"Attoclock & Initial Condition Methods","text":"(Image: fig:example_2cycs_CP)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual1_lasers/#lasers_doc","page":"The Lasers Module","title":"Manual: The Lasers Module","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual1_lasers/","page":"The Lasers Module","title":"The Lasers Module","text":"Lasers\nLaser","category":"page"},{"location":"manual1_lasers/#eTraj.Lasers","page":"The Lasers Module","title":"eTraj.Lasers","text":"module Lasers\n\nThe Laser module contains abstraction of laser and provides some pre-defined lasers for use.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"manual1_lasers/#eTraj.Lasers.Laser","page":"The Lasers Module","title":"eTraj.Lasers.Laser","text":"abstract type Laser\n\nRepresents an abstract laser, supertype of all lasers.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"manual1_lasers/","page":"The Lasers Module","title":"The Lasers Module","text":"Pages = [\"manual1_lasers.md\"]\nDepth = 3","category":"page"},{"location":"manual1_lasers/","page":"The Lasers Module","title":"The Lasers Module","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"manual1_lasers/#The-Monochromatic-Lasers","page":"The Lasers Module","title":"The Monochromatic Lasers","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual1_lasers/","page":"The Lasers Module","title":"The Lasers Module","text":"MonochromaticLaser","category":"page"},{"location":"manual1_lasers/#eTraj.Lasers.MonochromaticLaser","page":"The Lasers Module","title":"eTraj.Lasers.MonochromaticLaser","text":"abstract type MonochromaticLaser <: Laser\n\nRepresents an abstract monochromatic laser.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"manual1_lasers/","page":"The Lasers Module","title":"The Lasers Module","text":"A typical monochromatic laser is composed of the carrier wave cos (omega t+phi) and the envelope function f_rmenv(t) (which is assumed to have a peak amplitude of 1).

Comparison between the PMD obtained with the QTMC and SCTS phase methods reveals underestimation of the Coulomb interaction's influence on the phase by the QTMC method, which is observed in the number of nodal lines in the low-energy structures.","category":"page"},{"location":"example2_ShortLP_phase_methods/","page":"Short LP Pulses & Phase Methods","title":"Short LP Pulses & Phase Methods","text":"# examples/test_8cycs_LP.jl\n\nusing eTraj\nusing eTraj.Targets, eTraj.Lasers, eTraj.Units\n\nl = Cos2Laser(peak_int=90.0TW/cm^2, wave_len=800.0nm, cyc_num=8, ellip=0.0)\nt = get_atom(\"H\")\n\nfor phase_method in [:QTMC, :SCTS]\n    perform_traj_simulation(\n        init_cond_method    = :ADK,\n        laser               = l,\n        target              = t,\n        dimension           = 3,\n        sample_t_intv       = (-350,350),\n        sample_t_num        = 50000,\n        traj_t_final        = 500,\n        # perform the simulation only in the x-z plane\n        final_p_max         = (1.0,0.0,1.0),\n        final_p_num         = (500,1,500),\n        ss_kd_max           = 0.0,\n        ss_kd_num           = 1,\n        ss_kz_max           = 1.0,\n        ss_kz_num           = 20000,\n        output_path         = \"ADK-$(phase_method)_9e13_800nm_8cyc_LP_ExpRate.jld2\",\n        traj_phase_method   = phase_method,\n        rate_prefix         = :Exp\n    )\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"example2_ShortLP_phase_methods/","page":"Short LP Pulses & Phase Methods","title":"Short LP Pulses & Phase Methods","text":"# examples/test_1cyc_LP.jl\n\nusing eTraj\nusing eTraj.Targets, eTraj.Lasers, eTraj.Units\n\nl = Cos2Laser(peak_int=90.0TW/cm^2, wave_len=800.0nm, cyc_num=1, cep=π/2, ellip=0.0)\nt = get_atom(\"H\"; soft_core=1e-12)\n\nfor phase_method in [:QTMC, :SCTS]\n    perform_traj_simulation(\n        init_cond_method    = :ADK,\n        laser               = l,\n        target              = t,\n        dimension           = 3,\n        sample_t_intv       = (-50,50),\n        sample_t_num        = 30000,\n        traj_t_final        = 100,\n        final_p_max         = (1.0,0.0,1.0),\n        final_p_num         = (500,1,500),\n        ss_kd_max           = 0,\n        ss_kd_num           = 1,\n        ss_kz_max           = 1.5,\n        ss_kz_num           = 10000,\n        output_path         = \"ADK-$(phase_method)_9e13_800nm_1cyc_LP_ExpRate.jld2\",\n        traj_phase_method   = phase_method,\n        rate_prefix         = :Exp\n    )\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"example2_ShortLP_phase_methods/","page":"Short LP Pulses & Phase Methods","title":"Short LP Pulses & Phase Methods","text":"(Image: fig:example_8cycs_LP) (Image: fig:example_1cyc_LP)","category":"page"},{"location":"example2_ShortLP_phase_methods/","page":"Short LP Pulses & Phase Methods","title":"Short LP Pulses & Phase Methods","text":"[Arbo_2006]: D.

With the advent of laser technology, the intensity of light and the precision of spectroscopy has dramatically increased, which allows us to explore the physics of light-matter interaction under extreme conditions with unprecedented precision and accuracy. At a high laser intensity above TW/cm², the interaction between light and atoms or molecules can no longer be described by the perturbation theory and a series of novel strong-field phenomena emerges, such as the above-threshold ionization (ATI), tunneling ionization, high-harmonic generation (HHG) and non-sequential double ionization (NSDI).","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Theoretical studies of these non-perturbative phenomena have been extensively investigated in the past decades. Usually, in order to obtain a precise result, a time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) is solved numerically. However, solving the TDSE is computationally expensive and resource-demanding, which limits its application to few-dimensional problems. Moreover, the TDSE is like a black box, and therefore non-transparent for interpretation of the underlying physics. Apart from TDSE, the strong-field approximation (SFA) is also widely applied to study these problems, which is based on the assumptions that: (1) the initial state is not affected by the laser field until ionization; (2) after ionization, the photoelectron is not influenced by the trapping potential (i.e., assuming a short-range potential). These two approximations simplify the problem to some extent, which allows one to obtain analytical results and unravel the physical pictures of these phenomena. However, such approximations are not always appropriate for some cases when the Coulomb potential's role becomes significant, which may lead to incorrect predictions.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"To overcome the shortcomings of TDSE, Corkum et al. proposed a scheme, where the electron is first ionized from the target through the tunneling mechanism, then acts as a classical electron in the laser field, and finally the photoelectron spectra is obtained by statistics on the ensemble of the electron trajectories [Corkum_1989] [Corkum_1993]. This scheme was further developed by Hu et al., in which the initial conditions of the classical electrons and the Coulomb potential of the parent ion are more appropriately taken account [Hu_1997]. The scheme is named after the Classical-Trajectory Monte-Carlo (CTMC) method, which has been widely adopted. Further developments of the trajectory-based methods added a phase property to the electron orbits, and utilized the SFA for preparation of the initial conditions, for example, the Trajectory-based Coulomb-SFA (TC-SFA) [Yan_2010] [Yan_2012], the Quantum-Trajectory Monte Carlo (QTMC) [Li_2014] [Liu_2016], the Semiclassical Two-Step Model (SCTS) [ShvetsovShilovski_2016] [ShvetsovShilovski_2021], another approach which is named after the Coulomb Quantum-orbit SFA (CQSFA) [Lai_2015] [Maxwell_2017], chose the inverse problem by searching for all trajectories that arrived at the same final momenta. Such trajectory-based semiclassical methods have a notable advantage over the TDSE and direct SFA methods due to their low demand on computational resources, comparable accuracy to the TDSE, as well as the transparency of the physical picture.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"After years of development, various trajectory-based classical/semiclassical methods have flourished, but a unified theoretical framework has yet to be established.

With this aim, we present eTraj.jl, a program package written in the Julia language, which provides a general, efficient, and out-of-the-box solution for performing classical/semiclassical trajectory simulations.
