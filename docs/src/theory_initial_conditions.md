# Initial Conditions

*This section reviews commonly-used theories used to provide initial conditions in the trajectory simulations.*

A number of theories can be adapted to provide initial conditions of the classical electrons in the trajectory simulation scheme.
The initial condition usually consists of three properties:

 - Initial position $\bm{r}_0$ (i.e., the tunneling exit position);
 - Initial momenta $\bm{p}_0$, we note that in the trajectory simulation schemes, initial momentum are usually denoted using symbol $k$;
 - The corresponding ionization probability $W$ carried by each electron sample, depending on the time-dependent laser field and the properties of the target atoms/molecules.

In the following we will give a brief review on the available theories we implemented in *SemiclassicalSFI.jl*.
Atomic units (a.u.) are used throughout unless stated otherwise.

## Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK)

## Strong-Field Approximation (SFA)

## SFA Adiabatic Expansion (SFA-AE)

## Molecular ADK (MOADK)
